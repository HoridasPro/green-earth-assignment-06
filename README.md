1. (i)Var:Var is a function which we are declare in the function and can take to access array anywhere. It has hoisting whinh is up and it has defualt undefined. Re declare in the same scope.
(ii)Let: Let is a block scope. We access just in the that block hoiting like var but not initialize. Not re-declare in the same scope but it will update.
(ii)Const: Const is a block scope.it is hoiting but not initialize. Re-declare impossible and re-assignment impossible. If array or object then stay the same reference and the change the data.


  2.(i)forEach(): forEach drives the array element the loop not the return. Generally site-effect(console.log,DOM,Update for use)
  (ii)map():map works on the every element and make new array.
  (iii)filter(): Choose the element for condition stay the element for the new array.
  

  3.Array function introduced in the ES6 as a shorter syntax for writing function in javaScript.The also lexically bind this meaning this inside an arrow function refers to the surrounding scope.
  

  4.Desstructuring is a benefit in ES6 by which we take array and object evey easily in the variable. We get value index from the array and get value properti name from the object and can take defualt value in the array or object.
  

  5.Template literals is a backtick which we use varibale expresion and multi-line string
